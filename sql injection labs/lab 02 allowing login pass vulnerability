VULNERABILITY: 
SQL Injection- Login Bypass

LAB OBJECIVE: 
Gaining access to the main admin account

Process: 
 I started by navigating my way to the website and accessing the login page. My first attempt to log in with a random username failed. Next i proceeded in inputing  administrator'-- along with a random password, this ended up gaining me succesful access into the admin account.

RESULT: using administrator'-- as the username and other random passwords gained me access to the admin account. i also observed that login attempts fail if the password field is left blank.
